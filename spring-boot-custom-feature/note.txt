Application Context Hierarchy

Each Spring MVC webapp has one root application context and one servlet application context for each DispatcherServlet. 
The root application context is the parent of each servlet application context. 
Beans defined in "contextConfigLocation" (context-param in web.xml) are loaded into root application context. 
Beans in <servlet-name>-servlet.xml are loaded into servlet application context. 
If an EAR has multiple web apps, an EAR level application context can parent the root context of each webapp in EAR.

In Spring Boot,  if you have a web configuration, make sure itâ€™s being declared as a child. 
All the web configuration must depend on a main Spring context, which is why it needs to be declared as a child. 
Also parent and children must share the same org.springframework.core.Environment interface 
(this represents the environment in which the current application is running and is related to profiles and properties declarations).
